This is another day where I don’t get done until 7:30pm, which is only because my brain is done and I need to go home so I’m not useless tomorrow. This is a frustrating experience — my brain absorbs new information during the lecture but the things I learned last week still take a significant amount of cognitive energy to reproduce, i.e., loading assignments up to GitHub through the Terminal. Sure, I’ve done it before, but that doesn’t mean it’s automatic.
