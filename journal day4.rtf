Today I learned that this isn\'92t necessarily hard, but it also isn\'92t easy; and just because it isn\'92t easy, doesn\'92t mean it can\'92t be done. I also learned that it\'92s like learning a new spoken language - along with learning vocabulary, the learning person\'92s nervous system has to learn how to hear the language too. As the ear, cochlea, and acoustic nerve adjust, the brain gets better signals and can more accurately distill and discern. This is similar to coding in that part of learning includes learning how to understand and sort the information so the brain can accurately distill and learn. }
